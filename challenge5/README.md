# Palindromic Numbers

A palindrome is a word that can be reversed and is still the same word. Common examples include:
* racecar
* mom
* civic
* tenet

For a number to be a palindrome the same idea applies. Reverse the digits in the number and if they are equal then the number is a palindrome.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in a positive integer and returns a boolean indicating if that number is a palindrome. The incoming value will always be a valid integer > 0.

Unlike normal, there are a couple of rules:
* The incoming parameter will be a Number or Integer (as appropriate for the language used)
* All operations must be done with the value as a number. _No casting to strings_

### Test Cases:
This is not an exhaustive list of test cases, more may be added, but this should be representative.</br>

* 1 -> true
* 11 -> true
* 12 -> false
* 1234321 -> true
* 90091 -> false
